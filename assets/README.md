# Real-time Character Counter
## Description

This project is a real-time character counter that displays the number of characters entered into an input field and the remaining characters that can be entered. The counter updates in real-time as the user types into the input field. The project uses JavaScript to listen for changes to the input field and updates the character count and remaining characters accordingly. The input field and the character count are also styled using CSS.

### Requirements
Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
Internet connection (for the use of local storage)
Running the Project
To run the project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. You can do this by double-clicking on the file or by opening the file in your web browser of choice and navigating to the file.

## Customizing the Project
You can customize the maximum number of characters by modifying the following line of code:

var maxLength = 100;
Change the number to your desired maximum character limit.

### Known Issues and Limitations
Local storage is used to save the current character count, so the count will be lost if the browser's cache is cleared.
Internet connection is required for the use of local storage.
The input field does not have a maximum length limit, so the user can enter more characters than the allowed limit.
